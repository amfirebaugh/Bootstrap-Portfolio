# Bootstrap-Portfolio

-This was very challenging and I definitely felt like I was fighting the Bootstrap classes/CSS the whole way through...mostly because I just had to get familiar with it, and that was tough as a beginner. It definitely got easier through the assignment, and I think I sort of got the hang of it. This was mostly because I thought the assignment was to mimic our Basic Portfolio for majority of this week.

-Overall I think Bootstrap is a really interesting way to organize a website layout. I appreciate it more and think it's a very powerful tool available to web developers.

-Hardest thing for me was trying to customize the styles within the navbar and easiest thing for me was picking up on the container --> row --> column organization. Learning how to manipulate the styles and bootstrap classes (on a general level) is somewhere in the middle as the difficulty.
